It is an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
In the following code , you have to first input a number n (size of the input array ).Then in the next line you have to enter n, spaced integers(A[i]) of which you have to find the largest sum of subarray possible.


Constraints:
0<=n<10000
-10000<=A[i]<10000
